      <t>This memo specifies two authenticated encryption algorithms that are nonce misuse-resistant - that is that they do not fail catastrophically if a nonce is repeated.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The concept of "Authenticated encryption with additional data" (AEAD <xref target="RFC5116"/>) couples confidentiality and integrity in a single operation that is easier for practitioners to use correctly. The most popular AEAD, AES-GCM <xref target="GCM"/>, is seeing widespread use due to its attractive performance.</t>

      <t>However, most AEADs suffer catastrophic failures of confidentiality and/or integrity when two distinct messages are encrypted with the same nonce. While the requirements for AEADs specify that the pair of (key, nonce) shall only ever be used once, and thus prohibit this, in practice this is a worry.</t>

      <t>Nonce misuse-resistant AEADs do not suffer from this problem. For this class of AEADs, encrypting two messages with the same nonce only discloses whether the messages were equal or not. This is the minimum amount of information that a deterministic algorithm can leak in this situation.</t>

      <t>This memo specifies two nonce misuse-resistant AEADs: <spanx style="verb">AEAD_AES_128_GCM_SIV</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">AEAD_AES_256_GCM_SIV</spanx>. These AEADs are designed to be able to take advantage of existing hardware support for AES-GCM and can decrypt within 5% of the speed of AES-GCM. Encryption is, perforce, slower than AES-GCM because two passes are required. However, measurements suggest that it can still run at 2/3rds of the speed of AES-GCM.</t>

      <t>We suggest that these AEADs be considered in any situation where there is the slightest doubt about nonce uniqueness.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="POLYVAL">
      <t>The GCM-SIV construction is similar to GCM: the block cipher is used in counter mode to encrypt the plaintext and a polynomial authenticator is used to provide integrity. The authenticator in GCM-SIV is called POLYVAL.</t>

      <t>POLYVAL, like GHASH, operates in a binary field of size 2^128. The field is defined by the irreducible polynomial x^128 + x^127 + x^126 + x^121 + 1. The sum of any two elements in the field is the result of XORing them. The product of any two elements is calculated using standard (binary) polynomial multiplication followed by reduction modulo the irreducible polynomial.</t>

      <t>We define another binary operation on elements of the field: dot(a, b), where dot(a, b) = a * b * x^-128. The value of the field element x^-128 is equal to x^127 + x^124 + x^121 + x^114 + 1. The result, dot(a, b), of this multiplication is another field element.</t>

      <t>Polynomials in this field are converted to and from 128-bit strings by taking the least-significant bit of the first byte to be the coefficient of x^0, the most-significant bit of the first byte to the the coefficient of x^7 and so on, until the most-significant bit of the last byte is the coefficient of x^127.</t>

      <t>POLYVAL takes a field element, H, and a series of field elements X_1, ..., X_s. Its result is S_s, where S is defined by the iteration S_0 = 0; S_j = dot(S_{j-1} + X_j, H).</t>

      <t>We note that POLYVAL(H, X_1, X_2, ...) is equal to ByteSwap(GHASH(x*H, ByteSwap(X_1), ByteSwap(X_2), ...)), where ByteSwap is a function that converts a field element to a 128-bit string, reverses the order of the bytes, and interprets the result as a field element again.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Encryption">
      <t>AES-GCM-SIV encryption takes a 16-byte authentication key, a 16- or 32-byte AES key, a 128-bit nonce, and arbitrary-length plaintext and additional data inputs. It outputs an authenticated ciphertext that will be 16 bytes longer than the plaintext.</t>

      <t>If the AES key is 16 bytes long then AES-128 is used throughout and the <spanx>record-encryption key</spanx> is defined as the encryption of the nonce using the AES key.</t>

      <t>Alternatively, if the AES key is 32 bytes long then AES-256 is used throughout. Encrypting the nonce generates 128 bits of output, but this insufficient with AES-256 because 256 bits are needed. Thus the encryption of the nonce is used as the final 16 bytes of the record-encryption key and those sixteen bytes are encrypted again to generate the first sixteen bytes.</t>

      <t>In pseudo-code form:</t>
        <figure align="center">
          <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
if len(AES-key) == 16 {
  record-encryption-key = AES128(key = AES-key, input = nonce)
} else if len(AES-key) == 32 {
  second-half = AES256(key = AES-key, input = nonce)
  first-half = AES256(key = AES-key, input = second-half)
  record-encryption-key = concatenate(first-half, second-half)
}
]]></artwork>
        </figure>

      <t>Define the <spanx>length block</spanx> as a 16-byte value that is the concatenation of the 64-bit, little-endian encodings of len(additional_length)*8 and len(plaintext)*8. Pad the plaintext and additional data with zeros until they are each a multiple of 16 bytes, the AES block size. Then X_1, X_2, etc (the series of field elements that are inputs to POLYVAL) are the concatenation of the padded additional data, the padded plaintext and the length block.</t>

      <t>Calculate S_s = POLYVAL(authentication_key, X_1, X_2, ...), XOR it with the nonce and then set the most-significant bit of the last byte to zero. Encrypt the result with AES using the record-encryption key to produce the tag.</t>

      <t>The ciphertext is produced by using AES in counter mode on the unpadded plaintext. The initial counter block is the tag with the most-significant bit of the last byte set to one. The counter advances by incrementing the first 32 bits interpreted as an unsigned, little-endian integer. The result of the encryption is the resulting ciphertext followed by the tag.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Decryption">
      <t>Decryption takes a 16-byte authentication key, a 16- or 32-byte AES key, a 128-bit nonce, and arbitrary-length ciphertext and additional data inputs. It either fails, or outputs a plaintext that is 16 bytes shorter than the ciphertext.</t>

      <t>Firstly, the record-encryption key is derived in the same manner as when encrypting.</t>

      <t>If the ciphertext is less than 16 bytes or more than 2^36 + 16 bytes, then fail. Otherwise split the input into the encrypted plaintext and a 16-byte tag. Decrypt the encrypted plaintext with the record-encryption key in counter mode, where the initial counter block is the tag with the most-significant bit of the last byte. The counter advances in the same way as for encryption.</t>

      <t>Pad the additional data and plaintext with zeros until they are each a multiple of 16 bytes, the AES block size. Calculate length_block and X_1, X_2, etc as above and compute S_s = POLYVAL(authentication_key, X_1, X_2, ...). Compute the expected tag by XORing S_s and the nonce, setting the most-significant byte of the last byte to zero and encrypting with the record-encryption key. Compare the provided and expected tag values in constant time. If they do not match, fail. Otherwise return the plaintext.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="AEADs">
      <t>We define two AEADs, in the format of RFC 5116, that use AES-GCM-SIV: AEAD_AES_128_GCM_SIV and AEAD_AES_256_GCM_SIV. They differ only in the size of the AES key used.</t>

      <t>Since the definition of an AEAD requires that the key be a single value we define AEAD_AES_128_GCM_SIV to take a 32-byte key: the first 16 bytes of which are used as the authentication key and the remaining 16 bytes are used as the AES key. Likewise AEAD_AES_256_GCM_SIV takes an 48-byte key: the first 16 bytes are again the authentication key and the remaining 32 bytes is the AES key.</t>

      <t>The parameters for AEAD_AES_128_GCM_SIV are then: K_LEN is 32, P_MAX is 2^36, A_MAX is 2^61 - 1, N_MIN and N_MAX are 16 and C_MAX is 2^36 + 16.</t>

      <t>The parameters for AEAD_AES_256_GCM_SIV differ only in the key size: K_LEN is 48, P_MAX is 2^36, A_MAX is 2^61 - 1, N_MIN and N_MAX are 16 and C_MAX is 2^36 + 16.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Field operation examples">
      <t>Polynomials in this document will be written as 16-byte values. For example, the sixteen bytes 01000000000000000000000000000492 would represent the polynomial x^127 + x^124 + x^121 + x^114 + 1, which is also the value of x^-128 in this field.</t>

      <t>If a = 66e94bd4ef8a2c3b884cfa59ca342b2e and b = ff000000000000000000000000000000 then a+b = 99e94bd4ef8a2c3b884cfa59ca342b2e, a*b = 37856175e9dc9df26ebc6d6171aa0ae9 and dot(a, b) = ebe563401e7e91ea3ad6426b8140c394.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Worked example">
      <t>Consider the encryption of the plaintext "Hello world" with the additional data "example" under key 4f2229294acbdf99c4584ec0e6e23638fab3a110b8ae672eba07d91ba52d6cea using AEAD_AES_128_GCM_SIV. The random nonce that we'll use for this example is 752abad3e0afb5f434dc4310f71f3d21.</t>

      <t>The record encryption key will be AES(key = fab3a110b8ae672eba07d91ba52d6cea, data = 752abad3e0afb5f434dc4310f71f3d21) = b55e60e9e8886006db16db23e1e0e103.</t>

      <t>The length block contains the encoding of the bit-lengths of the additional data and plaintext, respectively, which are and 56 and 88. Thus length_block is 38000000000000005800000000000000.</t>

      <t>The input to POLYVAL is the padded additional data, padded plaintext and then the length block. This is 6578616d706c6500000000000000000048656c6c6f20776f726c64000000000038000000000000005800000000000000.</t>

      <t>The POLYVAL key will be the first 16 bytes of the AEAD key, namely 4f2229294acbdf99c4584ec0e6e23638. Calling POLYVAL with that key and the input above results in S_s = 0b9ae2c5bd7fe4dcd17a007d11ac280e. XORing this with the nonce gives 7eb058165dd05128e5a6436de6b3152f.</t>

      <t>Before encrypting the most-significant bit of the last byte is cleared. This again gives 7eb058165dd05128e5a6436de6b3152f because that bit happened to be zero already. Encrypting with the record key gives the tag, which is 8e2d69ed54c0997cae05d8b2be1d963e.</t>

      <t>In order to form the initial counter block, the most-significant bit of the last byte of the tag is set to one. This gives 8e2d69ed54c0997cae05d8b2be1d96be. Encrypting this with the record key gives the first block of the keystream: efc341b420fda4250c21e8571560d8f9.</t>

      <t>The final ciphertext is the result of XORing the plaintext with the keystream and appending the tag. That gives a7a62dd84fddd34a7e4d8c8e2d69ed54c0997cae05d8b2be1d963e.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="seccon">
      <t>The AEADs defined in this document calculate fresh AES keys for each nonce. This allows a larger number of plaintexts to be encrypted under a given key. Without this step, each SIV encryption would be like a standard GCM encryption with a random nonce. Since the nonce size for GCM is only 12 bytes, NIST set a limit <xref target="GCM"/> of 2^32 encryptions before the probability of duplicate nonces becomes too high.</t>

      <t>The authors felt that, while large, 2^32 wasn't so large that this limit could be safely ignored. For example, consider encrypting the contents of a hard disk where the AEAD record size is 512 bytes, to match the traditional size of a disk sector. This process would have encrypted 2^32 records after processing 2TB, yet hard drives of multiple terabytes are now common.</t>

      <t>Deriving fresh AES keys for each nonce eliminates this problem.</t>

      <t>If the nonce is fixed then AES-GCM-SIV acts like AES-GCM with a random nonce, with the caveat that identical plaintexts will produce identical ciphertexts. Thus, with a fixed nonce, the 2^32 limit still applies as the number of distinct messages that can be encrypted under a given key. Nonces should be unique and the misuse-resistance of these AEADs should not be depended on to the extent that 2^32 duplicates may occur.</t>

      <t>The construction of the record-encryption key in AEAD_AES_256_GCM_SIV cannot result in the first and second halves of the key having the same value. Thus 2^128 of the 2^256 keys cannot occur. We consider this to be insignificant.</t>

      <t>A security analysis of a similar scheme appears in <xref target="GCM-SIV"/>.</t>
